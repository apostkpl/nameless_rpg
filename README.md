## Nameless CLI RPG

Welcome to one of my pet projects. This project is intended to demonstrate the good ol' Java as a general purpose language.

__In this project we'll use:__

- _OOP (Classes, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance)_
- _Commonly used Java folder structures_
- _Newer technologies that complement Java, like Maven and Spring Boot_
- _SQL queries and database maintenance_

This is a test project, the goal is not to make a full fun game, and may never be finalized.

__Tools used in this project:__

[![tools](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=windows,debian,vscode,java,spring,maven,bash,git)](https://skillicons.dev)

_There are no "binaries" or install files available. And probably never will._
